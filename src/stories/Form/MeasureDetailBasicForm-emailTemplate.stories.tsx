    "Customs broker we use for inbound shipments of 3rd party customer materials is causing delays ( demurrage at airport; canâ€™t get a clear picture on delivery to the warehouse ). We are spending a half a day a week on this topic. For domestic shipments, via Transplace, we also need to support 3rd party logistics (e.g. Elevation). The training on Transplace seems there is functionality to get message notifications, which we would have to setup (TBC if all vehicles have trackers).",

    "Reduce time spent having to track all of this down and avoid demurrage costs, as possible.",
